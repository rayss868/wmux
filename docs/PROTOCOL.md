# wmux Substrate Protocol

> **Status:** Draft 1 (Phase 0 deliverable for Substrate 3.0). Expanded during Phase 1 M3 as the M0 MetadataStore lands.
> **Audience:** plugin authors, dashboard builders, orchestrators, and anyone integrating wmux as a substrate.
> **Companion docs:** [`api/inventory.md`](./api/inventory.md), [`api/versioning.md`](./api/versioning.md), [`api/stability.md`](./api/stability.md).

This document is the substrate contract. It describes the wire-level rules that external tools rely on, in enough detail to write a correct client without reading wmux source code.

---

## 0. Foundational model

wmux is a **terminal substrate**: it owns panes, terminal I/O, and the event bus. It does not own workflow logic. External tools (MCP plugins, dashboards, orchestrators) build workflow intelligence on top of these primitives.

Three contract layers:

1. **State surface:** `PaneMetadata` (per-pane) and `WorkspaceMetadata` (per-workspace). Mutable. Reads return the latest committed state.
2. **Event surface:** an in-memory ring buffer of lifecycle events, polled via `events.poll`. Lets clients react without continuous state polling.
3. **Identity surface:** `workspaceId`, `paneId`, `ptyId`, `bootId`, MCP server name, and the Named Pipe token. Determines who is talking to whom and what state survives daemon restarts.

The protocol below is the contract between wmux and clients across these three layers.

---

## 1. PaneMetadata semantics

### 1.1 Layered status

PaneMetadata has two layers:

- **Top-level fields** (`label`, `role`, `status`) — *shared display vocabulary*. Any tool may read or write. Reflects the most relevant human-facing workflow state at any given moment. Used by current and future wmux UI surfaces (pane headers, search results, sidebars) and by other tools that want a quick read of "what's this pane doing."
- **`custom` object** — *tool-specific extension*. Opaque to wmux. Each tool writes under its own namespace; deep-merge ensures cooperating tools don't clobber each other's keys.

This split came out of the RFC #15 discussion. The principle:

> Top-level fields are read by humans and other tools at a glance. Tool-specific richness lives under `custom.<tool>.*` and is parsed only by the tool that wrote it.

Multiple tools may write to `status` (the shared top-level field). wmux does not mediate. The convention is **last writer wins** for the shared field, with each tool also keeping its own rich state under `custom.<toolName>.status` (or similar). Tools that need precedence enforcement coordinate among themselves; wmux does not enforce ownership.

Optimistic concurrency (§1.3) is the substrate-level primitive for coordination when two writers race on the same field.

### 1.2 Namespacing convention

`custom` is a flat `Record<string, string>` (one-level deep-merged on `setMetadata`). The convention for keys:

- `<toolName>.<keyName>` — e.g. `orchestrator.taskId`, `qa.status`, `dashboard.lastRender`.
- Keys without a dot are permitted but discouraged; they're prone to semantic collision across tools.
- Reserved namespaces:
  - `wmux.*` — reserved for wmux itself (currently unused, claimed for future protocol-level fields).
  - `wmux.<server-name>.*` — reserved for an MCP server with that name. Per-plugin identity (see §4) anchors the namespace.

Cooperating tools should agree on namespacing out-of-band. The substrate does not validate namespace ownership; that's a §4 permission concern, not a §1 contract concern.

### 1.3 Versioning and optimistic concurrency

Each pane's metadata has a monotonic `version: number`, starting at 0 (no metadata ever set) and incrementing by 1 on every successful `setMetadata` or `clearMetadata`.

**`expectedVersion` (optional):**

```jsonc
// pane.setMetadata params
{
  "paneId": "p-123",
  "workspaceId": "ws-1",
  "status": "running",
  "expectedVersion": 7   // ← optimistic-concurrency check
}
```

If the current version is not `7`, the call returns JSON-RPC error `-32001`:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "req-42",
  "ok": false,
  "error": "VERSION_CONFLICT",
  "currentVersion": 11   // ← actual current version
}
```

The caller decides whether to retry (after re-reading or re-merging) or surrender.

**Canonical retry pattern.** When a write returns `VERSION_CONFLICT`, the client should:

1. **Read the current version** via `pane.getMetadata` or `pane.list`. The response carries the post-conflict `version` and the committed `metadata`.
2. **Re-compute the intended patch** against the new base. The conflict means another writer committed between your prior read and your write — your patch may now collide with theirs, or may need to merge differently.
3. **Retry `pane.setMetadata`** with `expectedVersion: <current_version>`. If another concurrent writer commits again during step 2, this retry conflicts too; loop until success or surrender.

The loop is bounded by application policy, not the substrate. A typical client implementation:

```ts
async function setWithRetry(
  paneId: string,
  computePatch: (base: PaneMetadata) => Partial<PaneMetadata>,
  maxAttempts = 5,
) {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt < maxAttempts; attempt++) {
    const { metadata, version } = await rpc('pane.getMetadata', { paneId });
    const patch = computePatch(metadata);
    try {
      return await rpc('pane.setMetadata', {
        paneId,
        ...patch,
        expectedVersion: version,
      });
    } catch (err) {
      // v2.9.0 surfaces VERSION_CONFLICT as a substring of the error
      // message ("VERSION_CONFLICT (currentVersion=N)"). v2.9.1+ will
      // also expose it as a structured `code: 'VERSION_CONFLICT'`
      // envelope; clients that read the envelope SHOULD prefer that
      // path and fall back to substring matching for older daemons.
      if (!String((err as Error).message).includes('VERSION_CONFLICT')) throw err;
      // backoff + retry (jittered exponential is a reasonable default)
    }
  }
  throw new Error('setWithRetry: maxAttempts exceeded');
}
```

Notes:

- The substrate provides no built-in retry — clients own the loop because the right backoff, max attempts, and "give up" policy are tool-specific.
- `mergeMode: 'replaceShared'` (see §1.4) does NOT bypass conflict detection; it changes the merge semantics, not the version-bump contract.
- The `version` returned in a successful reply is always the post-commit version; use it as the next `expectedVersion` if you intend to chain writes without re-reading.

**`expectedVersion` omitted:** no check; the call always commits. This is the v2.x behavior and stays the default for clients that haven't migrated to optimistic concurrency.

**`expectedVersion: 0` semantics:** `0` is the correct guard for a pane that has never been written. The call succeeds iff no concurrent writer has set anything on this pane yet — i.e. the current stored version is also `0`. Use this when you want a write to land only on a "blank" pane (e.g. the first tool to claim a freshly-spawned pane) and you do not want to clobber state that another tool may have already written between your read and your write. If any prior write committed, the call returns `VERSION_CONFLICT` with `currentVersion >= 1`.

**Version is committed in the same transaction as the merged shape.** The `mergeMode` evaluation, validation, persistence, and event emission all happen inside one synchronous critical section in the main-process `MetadataStore` (single-threaded JS provides natural serialization). The `version` returned on a successful write is always the version of the post-merge shape; the `pane.metadata.changed` event carries the same value.

### 1.4 mergeMode semantics

The v3.0 wire format has three modes:

| `mergeMode` | Semantics |
|---|---|
| `'merge'` (default) | Patch-style. Top-level fields in the patch overwrite existing values. The `custom` object deep-merges one level: keys in `patch.custom` overwrite same-named keys in `existing.custom`; other existing keys are preserved. |
| `'replace'` | Full overwrite. The new metadata equals exactly `patch`; everything not in `patch` is dropped, including `custom`. |
| `'replaceShared'` | Replace top-level shared fields (`label`, `role`, `status`) but preserve `custom`. Intended for tools that want to take ownership of the shared display vocabulary without disturbing other tools' tool-specific state. |

Legacy `merge: boolean` parameter remains for backwards compatibility:

- `merge: true` ⇒ `mergeMode: 'merge'`
- `merge: false` ⇒ `mergeMode: 'replace'`

When both `merge` and `mergeMode` are present on the same request, `mergeMode` wins; the legacy `merge` field is ignored, not an error. The legacy field is preserved so v2.8.x clients continue to work unchanged, but new clients SHOULD send `mergeMode` only and stop emitting `merge`.

### 1.5 Validation

Inputs are validated before commit. Failures return a JSON-RPC error with a descriptive message and **do not** increment `version`. Limits live in [`api/stability.md`](./api/stability.md#validation-limits-v30-baseline-values).

**Single source of truth.** All metadata field validation — types, length caps for `label`/`role`/`status`, the `custom` key/value contract, and the total serialized-byte cap — happens inside `MetadataStore.set` and `MetadataStore.clear`. The RPC handler layer is responsible only for wire-shape normalization (paneId resolution, `mergeMode` and `expectedVersion` type checks, workspaceId scoping); it does not re-validate the payload before forwarding it to the store. Two parallel validators would be a substrate liability — shared constants and near-identical branches inevitably drift across PRs and silently shadow each other. Keeping validation in one place ensures the version bump and the validate step stay atomic in the same critical section, and there is exactly one error message per rejection class.

---

## 2. Event bus contract

### 2.1 Polling model

The event bus is **pull, not push**. Clients call `events.poll(cursor)`; the bus returns all events with `seq > cursor` (subject to filters), plus a new cursor and a `bootId`.

Stdio MCP transport doesn't carry server-initiated notifications cleanly, and `daemon.readPromptEvents` already establishes the pull pattern. The 1024-event ring covers minutes of typical activity; bursts beyond that surface as `droppedCount > 0` and trigger client-side reconciliation via §2.5.

### 2.2 Cursor is opaque

Today, `cursor` is a monotonic 64-bit integer assigned by the bus. **Clients must not depend on this.** The substrate guarantees only:

- `cursor: 0` always means "replay from oldest in the ring."
- `nextCursor` returned from `events.poll` is the right value to pass back on the next poll. Do not increment, sort, or compare it.
- `nextCursor` is monotonically non-decreasing across calls from the same client (strictly increasing only when new events were delivered). Specifically: `nextCursor >= priorCursor` always; `nextCursor > priorCursor` if and only if at least one event was scanned past the cursor (including filter no-matches, which still advance the cursor — see §2.3).

Future evolutions (sharded rings, segmented cursors) may change the underlying encoding without notice. Opaque-cursor clients are unaffected.

### 2.3 Filtered polling

`events.poll` accepts `types?: WmuxEventType[]` and `workspaceId?: string` filters. The cursor advances on **scanned** events, not just matched ones — a subscriber filtering for `process.exited` across a busy bus doesn't re-scan unmatched events on every poll.

### 2.4 `bootId` and daemon restart

`bootId` is a UUIDv4 stamped at `EventBus` construction. Every `events.poll` response, every `pane.list` response, and `system.capabilities().features.events.bootId` all return the same value for the lifetime of a main-process run.

**Mismatch across calls means the daemon restarted under the caller.** Required client action:

1. Drop all cached state — pane ids, pty ids, cursors, last-seen workspace metadata.
2. Re-hydrate via `pane.list` (returns a new `asOfSeq` and `bootId`).
3. Resume `events.poll` with `cursor: asOfSeq`.

`bootId` mismatch is a stricter signal than `resync: true`. Cursor-window drift is recoverable by re-polling; daemon restart invalidates the entire seq space.

**Atomicity:** the `bootId` is set once when `EventBus` is constructed. It does not change while the main process is alive; the construction happens before any RPC handler can return a response. Clients can rely on the value remaining constant across the lifetime of a successful connection.

### 2.5 Snapshot reconciliation (`resync: true` and `droppedCount`)

If the caller's cursor drifted past the ring window (`cursor + 1 < oldestSeq`) **or** is in the future (`cursor > latestSeq`), the response carries `resync: true`. The `droppedCount` field is set when the drift is past the ring window (the daemon knows exactly how many events were missed).

Required client action on `resync: true`:

1. Stop trusting cached pane state.
2. Call `pane.list` to get a fresh snapshot. The response carries `{ asOfSeq, bootId, panes }`.
3. If `bootId` differs from your last known value, treat as a daemon restart (§2.4): drop everything else cached too.
4. Resume `events.poll` with `cursor: asOfSeq`.

`pane.list` is the substrate's snapshot primitive. It returns the full pane tree with metadata + version per pane, plus the `asOfSeq` watermark that anchors event replay.

### 2.6 PollResult fields, full

```jsonc
{
  "events": [/* WmuxEvent[] with seq > effectiveCursor */],
  "nextCursor": 412,
  "priorCursor": 380,    // ← echoes the cursor you passed in
  "bootId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "droppedCount": 3,     // ← set if drifted past ring window
  "resync": true         // ← set if drift or future cursor
}
```

`priorCursor` and `droppedCount` are diagnostic — clients can log them to detect partner-side problems (the caller was paused, the bus was too small for the burst rate, etc.).

### 2.7 Ordering caveat

Event `seq` is monotonic in **arrival order**, not in **causal order**. Two independent producers (PTYBridge in main; paneSlice via preload IPC) write to the bus on different paths. Within one producer, order is preserved; across producers, a same-tick `pane.created` (renderer-published) and `process.started` (main-published) can land in the bus in either order.

Clients must not assume `seq` order implies causal order across producer boundaries. Use timestamps (`ts`) for cross-producer reasoning when ordering matters.

---

## 3. Snapshot envelope (`pane.list`)

`pane.list` is more than a list. It returns:

```jsonc
{
  "asOfSeq": 412,
  "bootId": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "panes": [
    {
      "id": "p-1",
      "type": "leaf",
      // …tree structure…
      "metadata": { /* PaneMetadata */ },
      "version": 7                       // ← per-pane metadata version
    }
    // …more panes…
  ]
}
```

**Properties:**

- `asOfSeq` is the EventBus seq at the moment the snapshot was assembled. Events with `seq <= asOfSeq` are already reflected in `panes[*].metadata`; events with `seq > asOfSeq` are the next ones to consume via `events.poll(cursor: asOfSeq)`.
- `bootId` matches the EventBus's current value. Use it to detect daemon restarts.
- Snapshot is atomic from the client's perspective: the entire response is a consistent slice of state at `asOfSeq`. Internally, the M0 transaction-aware MetadataStore guarantees this — `pane.list` reads from a snapshot view of the store, not interleaved with concurrent writes.

This is the reconciliation primitive for §2.5.

---

## 4. Permission enforcement

The substrate has four enforcement points. All four exist to prevent one MCP from doing something it wasn't authorized to do.

| # | Point | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Method dispatch | v3.0 (new in Phase 2.1) | `wmuxPermissions` in the MCP server manifest declares which methods this server may call. RPC dispatcher rejects unauthorized calls. |
| 2 | Metadata path write | v3.0 (new in Phase 2.1) | `wmuxPermissions` may scope writes to specific `custom.<namespace>.*` paths. Writes outside the allowed paths are rejected. |
| 3 | Event subscription | v3.0 (new in Phase 2.1) | `events.poll` filters are enforced against `wmuxPermissions`. A server that hasn't declared subscription to `pane.created` can't see those events even if it polls. |
| 4 | Workspace claim | **v2.7.2 (already shipped)** | `mcp.claimWorkspace` binds an MCP server to a workspace. Subsequent writes targeting other workspaces are rejected. |

`wmuxPermissions` syntax (Phase 2.1 spec, draft): `<capability>[:<path-glob>]`. Examples:

- `pane.read` — read pane state and metadata.
- `meta.write` — write any pane's metadata (top-level + custom).
- `meta.write:custom.dashboard.*` — write only the `dashboard.*` paths inside `custom`.
- `events.subscribe:pane.*` — subscribe to `pane.created`, `pane.closed`, `pane.focused`, `pane.metadata.changed`.

Per-plugin identity is the MCP server name. Two servers with the same name on the same wmux instance is a registration error.

**Raw RPC bypass policy:** all four enforcement points are at method-dispatch level. There's no "internal" path that skips them; the IPC handler entry point is the chokepoint. The substrate does not expose a "trusted" mode that lets a plugin opt out of enforcement.

(Full `wmuxPermissions` spec lands in `api/mcp-plugin-spec.md` during Phase 2.1. This section is the contract sketch.)

## 5. Named Pipe security model

The wmux daemon exposes the JSON-RPC surface over a Windows Named Pipe at `\\.\pipe\wmux-rpc-<token>`.

### 5.1 Token-based authentication

Every connection must present the token from `%APPDATA%\wmux\pipe-token` in the first request:

```jsonc
{
  "id": "req-1",
  "method": "system.identify",
  "params": {},
  "token": "<base64-encoded-token>"
}
```

The token is a 256-bit random value generated on first daemon launch and persisted to disk. The file is written with `secureWriteTokenFile` — Windows OS ACLs restrict read access to the current user's SID; other users on the same machine cannot read it. The token is rotated only on explicit request (planned CLI: `wmux pipe rotate-token`).

### 5.2 Connection cap

`MAX_CONNECTIONS = 50` concurrent client connections per daemon. A new connection beyond the cap is rejected immediately. The cap protects against runaway plugin scenarios where a misbehaving client opens connections in a loop.

### 5.3 Why not ACL the pipe itself?

The pipe is created with a default DACL that allows the current user's processes to connect. Earlier plans proposed restricting the pipe DACL further; that approach was retired because:

- The token model already provides per-process authentication independently of OS user identity.
- Windows pipe DACL semantics interact awkwardly with elevated processes (admin shells reaching a non-elevated wmux daemon and vice versa).
- Token rotation is a clean recovery primitive; DACL re-tightening requires daemon restart.

The current model is: OS isolates users, token isolates processes, `mcp.claimWorkspace` isolates workspaces within a process, and `wmuxPermissions` isolates capability classes within a workspace. Defense in depth, with the token acting as the primary security boundary.

### 5.4 What the token does NOT authenticate

- **Plugin identity beyond "you have the token."** Two MCP servers connecting with the same token are distinguishable only by the `system.identify` they declare. The `wmuxPermissions`-based plugin identity model is the v3.0 strengthening of this.
- **Workspace ownership.** Any token-holder can read any workspace's state by default. `mcp.claimWorkspace` is the opt-in scoping mechanism; tools that don't claim get read-only-style access to the full surface.
- **Transport encryption.** Named Pipe is a local IPC; the OS is the trust boundary. Cross-machine access would require a different transport (WebSocket + TLS, planned for v3.1+).

---

## 6. Identity model

| Identifier | Lifetime | Cache invalidation signal |
|---|---|---|
| `workspaceId` | persisted across daemon restarts | — (stable) |
| `paneId` | one daemon run | `bootId` change |
| `ptyId` | one PTY process | `process.exited` event |
| `bootId` | one main-process run | itself (mismatch = restart) |
| MCP server name | stable as long as the server is registered | re-registration |
| Pipe token | persisted on disk; rotated explicitly | token rotation event (planned) |

The two stable-across-restart identifiers are `workspaceId` and MCP server name. Everything else is single-run; clients must reconcile via `pane.list` after a `bootId` change.

---

## 7. Known limitations and v3.0 boundaries

Things external clients may run into that aren't bugs but are explicit substrate boundaries:

- **Workspace identity blocker (open).** The `project_workspace_identity_fix.md` issue exists but is being investigated in Phase 1 M4. Today, an MCP server that claims workspace A and then writes metadata with an explicit `workspaceId: B` is rejected (correct), but the active-pane resolution path when *no* `workspaceId` is provided can hijack to whichever workspace the user is viewing. External callers SHOULD pass `workspaceId` explicitly to bypass this.
- **No buffer access yet.** `terminal.readEvents` covers structured prompt events; arbitrary scrollback buffer reads are partial via `input.readScreen`. The cross-workspace policy gate for full buffer access is a v3.1+ design item.
- **Cursor evolution.** The opaque-cursor guarantee is a forward-compat hedge. If sharded rings ship in v3.x, the encoding may change; opaque-cursor clients are unaffected by design.
- **Layered status precedence.** The substrate does not enforce precedence among writers of the top-level `status` field. Last writer wins. Tools that need precedence should coordinate via `custom.<tool>.status` and pick one tool to own the shared field.
- **Cross-producer ordering.** `seq` is arrival order, not causal order. See §2.7.

## 8. Change history of this document

| Version | Date | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Draft 1 | 2026-05-12 | Phase 0 initial draft. Covers PaneMetadata layered status, mergeMode, version + expectedVersion, bootId, cursor opaqueness, snapshot envelope, permission enforcement (sketch), Named Pipe security model. Phase 1 M3 will expand. |

This document evolves alongside the implementation. Changes that affect the wire contract require a major-version bump per [`api/versioning.md`](./api/versioning.md). Changes that clarify existing semantics ship in any release.
