// ─── ChannelService ────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Daemon-side channel state owner. The ONLY writer to ChannelState — every
// mutation funnels through this service so the per-channel mutex, idempotency
// LRU, and `saveImmediate` PERSIST_FAILED surfacing stay in one place.
//
// The service holds:
//   - `state: ChannelState` — in-memory mirror, loaded from the writer at
//     construction and re-saved on every mutation. The writer is the
//     persistence model; this service is the in-memory authoritative copy
//     for the lifetime of the daemon.
//   - `mutexes: Map<channelId, Promise<void>>` — per-channel promise chain.
//     Each mutation for a given channelId waits for the previous one to
//     finish. Channels don't contend with each other (different keys).
//   - `idempotency: Map<channelId, Map<clientMsgId, {seq, lastUsedAt}>>` —
//     LRU cache of recent clientMsgIds, capped at CHANNEL_IDEMPOTENCY_CAP
//     per channel. Lookups in the post path are O(1) amortized; eviction
//     is O(n) only on overflow.
//
// Plan reference: U3 (a2a-channels service layer).

 *     bypass the byte cap (`CHANNEL_BODY_MAX` is measured on this
 *     sanitized form).
 *
 * Unicode whitespace beyond C0 (e.g. zero-width joiner U+200D,
 * non-breaking space U+00A0) is intentionally NOT stripped here —
 * the renderer / MCP tools treat it as content. If a future
 * "normalize Unicode" rule is added it should land in a single
 * shared helper, not in each transport.
