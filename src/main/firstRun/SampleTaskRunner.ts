/**
 * SampleTaskRunner — wait for an OSC133 prompt-ready handshake on a PTY data
 * source, then inject the deterministic `SAMPLE_TASK_COMMAND` followed by `\r`.
 *
 * Architectural note (decisions.md D7-C1+C2):
 *   wmux has two PTY data paths — non-daemon (`PTYBridge.addMiddleware`) and
 *   daemon (`daemonClient.on('session:data')`). This runner is intentionally
 *   agnostic to either: it consumes a `PtyDataSource` adapter that the
 *   FirstRunOrchestrator (T4) wires up.
 *
 * Lifecycle:
 *   - `run(source, signal)` subscribes to `source.onData`, accumulates a
 *     bounded byte buffer, and scans for the strict OSC133 "A" sequence
 *     (BEL or ST terminator — see `OSC133_PROMPT_READY_PATTERNS`).
 *   - On match: writes the command, disposes, resolves `{ outcome: 'ok' }`.
 *   - On `OSC133_TIMEOUT_MS` elapsed: disposes, resolves `{ outcome: 'timeout' }`.
 *   - On `signal` aborted (either at call time or mid-flight): disposes,
 *     resolves `{ outcome: 'aborted' }`. The promise never rejects.
 *
 * The buffer is capped (`MAX_BUFFER_BYTES`, 64 KiB) to prevent unbounded
 * growth on long-running shells that never emit OSC133. We slice from the
 * tail and keep at least `OSC_OVERLAP_BYTES` bytes of overlap so a sequence
 * straddling the cap boundary still matches.
 *
 * See: progress.md (T3), decisions.md (D3, D7-C1, D7-C2), src/shared/firstRun.ts.
