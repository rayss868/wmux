// ─── Command Deck — orchestrator scheduler (P3d) ─────────────────────────────
//
// The tick loop that turns persisted schedules (deckScheduleStore) into
// orchestrator turns. Main-process, transport-free: it takes a `runTurn`
// callback (deck.handler wires it to the commander manager) and injectable
// clock/timer deps so tests drive it deterministically.
//
// Semantics:
//   - one tick every TICK_MS (and one immediately on start): fire every due,
//     enabled schedule IN SERIES (the manager is one-turn-at-a-time anyway).
//   - a `busy` reject leaves the schedule due — it retries next tick after the
//     human's (or another schedule's) turn finishes. ok/error consume the
//     occurrence: repeats advance past now (no catch-up storms after sleep),
//     one-shots flip to disabled but stay listed.
//   - store writes are read-modify-write per fire against the CURRENT file so
//     a schedule edited mid-turn isn't clobbered by a stale in-memory copy.
