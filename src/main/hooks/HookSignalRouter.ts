// HookSignalRouter — dedup arbiter between deterministic hook signals
// (from integrations/<agent>/bin/wmux-bridge.mjs) and heuristic
// AgentDetector emissions (regex-driven, in src/main/pty/AgentDetector.ts).
//
// The Iron Rule: hook signal wins. AgentDetector is the fallback path
// for environments where the plugin isn't installed. When both fire
// within a 10s window, the second one is suppressed.
//
// ASCII timing diagrams:
//
//   Hook arrives first, detector follows within 10s
//   t0: hook    → ledger.set(slug:ptyId = {kind, ts: t0, source:'hook'})
//                  → emit notification
//   t0+200ms: detector → ledger lookup → source='hook', kind matches,
//                                         ts within window → DEDUP, no emit
//
//   Detector arrives first, hook follows within 10s
//   t0: detector → ledger.set(slug:ptyId = {kind, ts: t0, source:'detector'})
//                   → emit notification
//   t0+50ms: hook → ledger lookup → kind matches, ts within window → DEDUP
//                   → still records latency (the value of the hook is
//                     measurement here, not user-visible emission)
//
//   Hook arrives, but no detector ever fires (plugin-only path)
//   t0: hook    → emit
//   t0+1m: hook again (different kind) → emit again
//
//   Detector arrives, no plugin installed
//   t0: detector → emit
//   This is the legacy heuristic behavior, unchanged from pre-plugin wmux.
