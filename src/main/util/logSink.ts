/**
 * Persistent log sink for the main process.
 *
 * Why this exists: wmux historically wrote logs only to stderr. In packaged
 * Windows builds stderr has no parent console, so structured error traces
 * (wrapHandler IPC errors, daemon disconnects, scrollback restore failures)
 * vanished. When a user reports a bug after a reboot, there is no postmortem
 * artifact to inspect.
 *
 * This sink:
 *   - tees process.stderr.write to a daily-rotated log file in
 *     `app.getPath('logs')` (Windows: %APPDATA%\wmux\logs\main-YYYY-MM-DD.log)
 *   - exposes `logLine(level, source, message)` for explicit instrumentation
 *
 * Best-effort: every write is wrapped in try/catch. The sink must never
 * crash the main process.

 * writes are buffered up to the default 16KB high-water-mark and only
 * flush to disk on stream end/drain. For a long-lived main process that
 * emits small, infrequent log lines, this leaves the file at 0 bytes on
 * disk for the entire session — defeating the whole point of a
 * postmortem log sink. fs.appendFileSync writes immediately, fsyncs,
 * and returns, so every log line is durably on disk before the call
 * returns. The synchronous cost is acceptable for diagnostic-rate
 * logging (a few writes per second at peak) and is mandatory if we
