/**
 * Regression test for the chronic "front of paste disappears" bug.
 *
 * Symptom (reported repeatedly across releases, finally diagnosed v2.9.1):
 *   Pasting multi-line text into a PTY pane lost the leading portion of
 *   the paste — typically the first few lines vanished and the remainder
 *   appeared on a fresh prompt. Right-click paste and Shift+Insert paste
 *   were also affected. The corruption was non-deterministic and worse on
 *   PowerShell / Claude Code TUI panes.
 *
 * Root cause:
 *   Three compounding bugs in the renderer paste pipeline, plus one in
 *   main. The main-side bug — the only one this test guards — was that
 *   `pty:write` silently dropped any payload over 100KB:
 *
 *     if (data.length > 100_000) {
 *       console.warn(...);
 *       return;   // ← silent drop, renderer never knows
 *     }
 *
 *   Renderer-side chunking (`clipboardChunk.ts`) kept normal paste under
 *   the limit, but any code path that bypassed the chunker — drag-drop
 *   joins, command palette replay of pasted history, xterm's native
 *   paste path via `terminal.onData`, future MCP write paths — could
 *   hit the silent drop and lose user data. The renderer used
 *   `ipcRenderer.send` (fire-and-forget), so there was no error surfaced
 *   either.
 *
 * Fix:
 *   Main now segments oversize payloads locally and forwards every byte.
 *   The 100KB threshold becomes a "warn-and-segment" boundary, not a
 *   drop boundary. A separate 10MB hard limit guards against true
 *   denial-of-service payloads (those still get refused, but logged
 *   loudly via console.error so the caller is visible). Renderer
 *   chunking remains the primary path; main-side segmentation is
 *   defense-in-depth for callers that bypass it.
 *
 * This test is structural: it scans `pty.handler.ts` and fails if a
 * future refactor reintroduces the silent drop. Behavioral coverage of
 * the segment math itself lives in `clipboardChunk.test.ts`
 * (`splitSurrogateSafe`); main and renderer share the same surrogate-
 * safety invariant, but the runtime path is hard to exercise without a
 * mocked DaemonClient + PTYManager.
