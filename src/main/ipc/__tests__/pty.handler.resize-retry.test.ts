/**
 * Regression test for the v2.9.0-rc.1 recovery-PTY mute race.
 *
 * Symptom (reported during v2.9.0-rc.1 dogfood, Windows reboot):
 *   After a reboot, every recovered pane accepted keystrokes but
 *   dropped echo and command output. Switching to another workspace
 *   and back restored output — at the cost of visual interference
 *   between the newly-flushed buffer and the previously-restored
 *   scrollback content.
 *
 * Root cause:
 *   Recovery sessions are created with `deferOutput=true`, which
 *   leaves the DaemonPTYBridge muted until `resizeSession` runs
 *   (DaemonSessionManager.ts:290-298 — the unmute trigger lives
 *   inside `resizeSession`, not `attachSession`). When useTerminal's
 *   first resize RPC lands before `daemon.attachSession` has
 *   registered the session, the daemon throws "Session 'X' not
 *   found", and the prior single-shot try/catch in `pty:resize`
 *   silently swallowed that error — so the bridge stayed muted
 *   forever.
 *
 *   Workspace switching triggered `fit()` again via useTerminal's
 *   visibility effect (useTerminal.ts:705-732), which retried the
 *   resize after attach had completed — unmuting the bridge and
 *   flushing the accumulated ring buffer over the restored
 *   scrollback area (the visual interference).
 *
 * Fix history:
 *   7d5fee3 (Wed May 13 10:03) "fix(daemon): unmute recovery PTY on
 *   attach via geometry handoff" — reordered daemon attach/resize so
 *   attach itself unmuted. Reverted in e032ae3 (Wed May 13 13:38)
 *   because the new sequencing hit an OSC 7 ConPTY interaction
 *   (`e]7;file://HOST/...` rendered as raw text on first prompt).
 *   The revert message named two v2.9.1 fix options:
 *     (1) retry-on-not-found in pty.handler.ts pty:resize  ← this fix
 *     (2) attach-ack-then-resize ordering driven from the renderer
 *
 *   Option (1) is the smallest blast radius: it does not reorder
 *   daemon-side attach/resize, so the OSC 7 regression cannot
 *   resurface. The retry rides out the attach race entirely on the
 *   main-process IPC handler boundary.
 *
 * This test is structural: it scans `pty.handler.ts` and fails if a
 * future refactor strips the retry loop or weakens the constants.
 * A behavioral test using a mocked DaemonClient would also work, but
 * the structural shape of the bug is "the wrong single-shot catch is
 * called from the wrong place" — checking the source directly catches
 * the regression with no plumbing.
