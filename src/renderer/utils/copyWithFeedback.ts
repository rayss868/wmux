/**
 * Pure orchestration for "copy selection → clipboard, with success/error
 * feedback".
 *
 * Background:
 * The Electron main-process clipboard handler now throws (with codes such as
 * CLIPBOARD_TOO_LARGE / CLIPBOARD_INVALID_TYPE / CLIPBOARD_WRITE_FAILED) on
 * failure. Previously the renderer fired-and-forgot
 * `clipboardAPI.writeText()`, cleared the selection, and showed a success
 * toast — meaning failures were invisible and the user thought the copy had
 * worked. This helper awaits the write and routes success/failure to the
 * correct UI path while keeping the selection intact on error so the user
 * can retry without re-dragging.
 *
 * Kept in its own module so it can be unit-tested in vitest's default `node`
 * environment (without pulling in xterm / WebGL / DOM-dependent imports).
