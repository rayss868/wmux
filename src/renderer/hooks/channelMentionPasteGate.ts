// ─── Channel-mention paste gate — unknown-status grace window ────────────────
//
// RCA 2026-07-05 (idle-since-attach delivery block): the mention flush skips a
// pane whose agent is BUSY. Busy is read from `surfaceAgent[ptyId].status`,
// which AgentDetector only sets when a status PATTERN flows through the pty
// output (e.g. Claude's "bypass permissions on" idle-prompt fragment → 'waiting').
//
// An agent that has been idle since its pty attached never re-emits that pattern
// — it just sits emitting cursor-position queries — so its status stays
// `undefined`. The old gate treated `undefined` as busy FOREVER (fail-closed),
// relying on the agent's next Stop to flush the queued mention. But a
// continuously-idle agent never Stops, so the mention was stuck until an
// unrelated repaint (observed: splitting the pane) forced Claude to redraw the
// idle prompt, which finally emitted 'waiting'. Cross-workspace mentions to a
// background pane are exactly this case: the pane never gets focus, never
// repaints, never delivers.
//
// The fail-closed WAS load-bearing for one real window: right after attach a
// genuinely-running agent's first 'running' broadcast may not have landed yet,
// and pasting into a running agent corrupts its turn. That window is transient
// (a running agent produces output → ActivityMonitor 'active' → 'running' within
// ~1 output burst). So we keep fail-closed for a short GRACE period after the
// first unknown observation, then treat persistent-unknown as idle and deliver.
// A status that stays `undefined` past the grace means the agent produced no
// activity = quiet/idle, which is paste-safe.
//
// RCA 2026-07-05 (mid-turn paste race, Codex+Claude CRITICAL): grace ALONE is a
// leaky gate. A background agent that is genuinely thinking / emitting tokens
// SLOWLY can sit at status `undefined` past the grace — its output bursts stay
// under ActivityMonitor's 2000-byte/3s threshold, so no 'running' broadcast ever
// lands — and the grace-only gate then pastes MID-TURN and corrupts the turn.
// The naive fix ("any raw pty output = busy") reintroduces the c8b3bf9 bug: an
// idle agent still emits sparse output (cursor-position queries), so raw-output
// gating would hold an idle mention forever. So we require BOTH gates to clear:
//   - GRACE (4s) since first-unknown, AND
//   - OUTPUT-QUIET (2s) since the pty's last observed output.
// A thinking agent repaints its status line on a ~1s timer, so it never crosses
// the 2s quiet bar → held. A truly idle agent emits only rare queries, clears
// the quiet bar → delivered. The last-output timestamps are fed by a global
// pty-data listener (see useChannelsEventSubscription) and pruned per-pty via
// prunePasteGateState so the maps can't leak dead ptys.
//
// Known statuses: 'running'/'awaiting_input' busy, everything else (including
// 'waiting'/'complete'/'idle') paste-safe immediately — with two more 2026-07-05
// hardening passes layered on top:
//   - STALE-RUNNING: a 'running' agent that hangs mid-turn keeps status 'running'
//     forever while emitting nothing, so the gate would hold the mention forever
//     (silent never-deliver). We anchor the observation start on the first
//     'running' sight and, once the pty has been output-quiet for RUNNING_STALE_MS
//     (3 min), treat 'running' as stale and deliver (one console.debug for
//     visibility). A genuinely-thinking agent repaints its ~1s status line, which
//     refreshes the anchor via notePtyOutput, so it never trips the bar.
//   - FLAP GUARD: a known-status tick used to clear firstUnknownAt immediately, so
//     a 1-tick blip (a lone 'running'/'waiting' sample) mid-hold re-armed the
//     unknown clock and pushed the MAX_UNKNOWN_HOLD ceiling far into the future.
//     We now only clear firstUnknownAt once the known status has held for
//     KNOWN_STABLE_MS (stableKnownSince tracks the streak start); an unknown tick
//     drops that streak. A real resolution clears within 10s; a blip never does.
//   - CPR NOISE: an idle TUI still answers DSR/CPR cursor queries. notePtyOutput
//     takes the raw chunk and ignores DSR/CPR-only chunks so cursor chatter
//     neither refreshes the stale anchor nor pins the quiet gate.
