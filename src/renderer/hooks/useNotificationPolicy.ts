/**
 * T7 — Notification policy decision function.
 *
 * Pure (stateless, no React/store coupling) function that translates one
 * notification event + the current renderer settings into the ordered list
 * of side-effect actions the listener should execute. Despite the `use*`
 * filename, this is NOT a React hook — the prefix is preserved so the file
 * can live alongside `useNotificationListener.ts` (its sole consumer) and
 * future readers find it via the same `hooks/` naming convention.
 *
 * Rationale for the split (CEO stamp: "boil the lake"):
 * Before T7, every gating decision (active-surface skip, mute, toast/sound/
 * ring/flashFrame fan-out) lived inline in the listener's IPC subscribe
 * callback as a 40-line if/else cascade. That made each new gate require a
 * full integration test with mocked IPC + zustand store, and there were
 * zero unit tests pinning the gate logic itself. Extracting the policy:
 *   - keeps the listener thin (target resolution + dispatch only),
 *   - lets us pin every gate combination in a vitest unit test with no
 *     mocks, no jsdom, no IPC plumbing,
 *   - leaves throttle/debounce on the listener side because those need
 *     long-lived closure state (a stateless policy + a stateful listener
 *     compose cleanly).
 *
 * Action list semantics:
 *   - `addNotification` is the data-preservation action — it ALWAYS comes
 *     first and is the ONLY action emitted for muted workspaces. The
 *     listener relies on this ordering for the "data preserved, surfaces
 *     silent" promise (Policy A4 / T4).
 *   - All other actions (toast/sound/ring/flashFrame) are "surface" actions
 *     gated by user settings. Order between them is stable (the test suite
 *     pins it) but not load-bearing for correctness.
 *
 * Throttling: the policy is intentionally stateless. If `flashFrame` or
 * `playSound` appear in the returned list, the listener's per-call-site
 * `createThrottler` decides whether to actually execute them. Pushing
 * throttle logic into the policy would either (a) require the policy to
 * own mutable state, breaking its purity contract, or (b) require passing
 * throttler handles in via PolicyContext, which double-wires the listener's
 * internal throttler instances into every test fixture for no benefit.
