// ─── Renderer-side channel.message + agent.lifecycle subscription ────────
//
// The renderer has no inbound event subscription mechanism today
// (`events.publish` in `src/preload/preload.ts` is one-way outbound). To
// react to `channel.message` events without a full main-process→preload
// push channel, we mirror the PluginFrame forwardEvents pattern
// (see `src/renderer/plugins/PluginFrame.tsx:81-112`): a 1-second
// `events.poll` loop, scoped to `channel.message`, dispatched into
// `channelsSlice.appendMessageFromEvent`.
//
// Why a renderer-side poll is OK here:
//   - The ring read is in-process (main → renderer IPC is a single
//     invoke) and costs ~one poll per second. The PluginFrame precedent
//     runs at the same cadence.
//   - Channels are a low-frequency, low-stakes surface — even a
//     2-3s tail-latency on a new message is fine for chat.
//   - We scope the poll to `types: ['channel.message', 'agent.lifecycle']`
//     so the response carries only channel traffic plus agent turn-boundary
//     (Stop) events — the latter triggers P1 autoresponse: queued @-mention
//     tasks are pasted into the now-idle pane's PTY (see channelMentionFlush).
//     The renderer still never pays for pane/process/notification events.
//
// Per-recipient scoping (FIX-MULTI-WS): the poll is scoped to the UNION of
// every local workspace (`workspaceIds` param — daemon filters by set
// membership, see events.rpc.ts). Channels are workspace-independent, so a
// mention of a pane in a BACKGROUND workspace must deliver while the user is
// viewing another one — the v1 single-workspace poll silently dropped those.
// One loop, one cursor: the first multi-loop attempt (one poll loop per
// workspace) regressed same-workspace delivery and was reverted; the union
// scope keeps the loop structurally identical to v1. Because the batch now
// carries OTHER workspaces' events, this hook re-filters per event: display
// state (message cache / unread / catalog hydration) only for events relevant
// to the ACTIVE workspace, mention routing + flush for EVERY local recipient
// workspace.
//
// Resync handling: `events.poll` returns `resync: true` when the caller's
// cursor drifted past the 1024-event ring window. On resync we drop the
// local message cache for the channel(s) and let the next refresh rebuild
// it — the message catalog is durable in the daemon, so a transient
// cache loss is recoverable.
//
// Boot cursor: starting at `0` replays every still-in-ring channel
// message. For a renderer that mounted seconds after the daemon this is
// fine (the ring is 1024 events, usually empty of channel traffic
// shortly after boot). For a renderer that mounted minutes later, the
// ring may have already wrapped past those messages — `resync: true`
// triggers the recovery path.
//
// Mount: `useEffect` in AppLayout (registered once per renderer
// lifetime, parallel to `useApprovalInboxBridge`).
//
// Plan reference: U6 (a2a-channels renderer integration).
