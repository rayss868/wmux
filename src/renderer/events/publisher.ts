// === Renderer-side EventBus publisher ===
//
// Thin shim around the preload IPC channel. Slice methods call these helpers
// inside their state mutations so external tooling can poll the EventBus on
// main and see pane lifecycle. Failures are swallowed — telemetry never
// breaks a state mutation.
//
// NOTE on `pane.metadata.changed`: There is intentionally no renderer-side
// publisher for this event. As of v2.9.0 (M0-d) the renderer no longer owns
// the metadata write path; `MetadataStore` (main process) is the sole writer
// and emits `pane.metadata.changed` directly on the main-process EventBus
// from inside its synchronous critical section. A renderer publisher would
// race the store's own emit and could surface stale `version` values to
// subscribers. If you need to react to metadata changes, poll the EventBus
// or rely on `pane.list` reconciliation.

/**
 * A2A (agent-to-agent) task lifecycle tee. A dual-party event: it carries
 * explicit `from` (sender) + `to` (receiver) workspaceIds, and the base
 * `workspaceId` is ALWAYS stamped === `from` (fail-safe scoping — see the
 * A2aTaskEvent doc in shared/events.ts and the dual-party post-filter in
 * events.rpc.ts). The event is a POINTER: by default it carries no
 * `messagePreview` (the party fetches the body via a2a_task_query). The
 * preview param is accepted but only attached when explicitly provided.
 *
 * The publish trust boundary (registerHandlers.ts) re-stamps workspaceId=from
 * and allow-lists the shape server-side, so a renderer-supplied workspaceId
 * that disagrees with `from` can never broaden scope. Emitting `from` as the
 * base here keeps the two in agreement on the happy path.
 *
 * `verifiedItemCount` (§6.M PR-C): count of verified completion-evidence items,
 * attached on completed/failed transitions only. `0` is a meaningful signal
 * (unverified completion), so it is included when present — the guard is
 * `!== undefined`, NOT truthiness (same pattern as messagePreview).
