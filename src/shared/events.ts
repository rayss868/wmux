// === wmux Event Bus types ===
//
// Lightweight event surface for external tooling (Claude Code, third-party MCPs)
// that want to react to pane/process lifecycle without polling the full state.
// Events are pull-only via `events.poll(cursor)` — pull cursor is the seq number
// of the last seen event; the bus returns events with `seq > cursor`.
//
// The ring is in-memory only and lives for the lifetime of the main process.
// Daemon restarts clear the ring; clients that drift past the ring window get
// a `resync: true` flag and should reconcile via `pane.list`. Each main-process
// run also gets a `bootId` (UUIDv4) so clients can distinguish "we drifted
// past the window" from "the daemon restarted under us" — the latter
// invalidates the entire seq space, not just the events you missed.
//
// Workspace scoping: each event carries a `workspaceId`; `events.poll` filters
// by the caller's claimed workspace by default so workspaces stay isolated.
//
// === Ordering caveat ===
//
// `seq` is monotonic in **arrival order**, not in **causal order**. Two
// independent producers (PTYBridge emits in-process from main; paneSlice
// publishes through preload IPC) write to the bus on different paths. Within
// one producer the order is preserved, but across producers a same-tick
// `pane.created` (renderer-published) and `process.started` (main-published)
// can land in the bus in either order. Clients must not assume seq order
// implies causal order across producer boundaries.

/**
 * Fires when an inner agent (Claude Code, etc.) finishes a turn, surfaces a

 * shell integration. Three sources stream so callers can compare and pick:
 *
 *   - `source:'hook'`      — Claude Code hook bridge. Deterministic, sub-200ms.
 *                             Carries `agent` (the hook plugin knows who fired).
 *   - `source:'detector'`  — Regex-based AgentDetector. Heuristic, ~1-2s lag.
 *                             Carries `agent` (regex gates identify the agent).
 *   - `source:'osc133'`    — Shell integration OSC 133 D marker. Latency-zero,
 *                             shell-agnostic (any CLI: npm, pytest, make...).
 *                             `agent` may be `null` when no agent context is
 *                             known; `exitCode` is set when the marker carried
 *                             one (`OSC 133;D;<n>`).
 *
 * The dedup ledger inside HookSignalRouter decides whether a fan-out
 * notification fires (`decision`); the event itself is emitted regardless so
 * external consumers (orchestrator clients) see all three signals for
 * forensic / replay purposes. OSC 133 events are not dedup-gated — they
 * represent shell command lifecycle, not agent turn boundaries — and always
 * carry `decision:'emit'`.
 *
 * Intentionally omitted: `agent.activity` (per-tool-call) and
 * `agent.session_start`. activity events can fire 5-30 times per turn per
 * pane; including them would overrun the 1024 ring on any multi-pane
 * workflow. Consumers who need activity granularity should subscribe to
 * SIGNAL_HEALTH_UPDATE in-renderer instead.
 *
 * Carries `ptyId` only, not `paneId`. Resolving paneId from ptyId requires
 * a renderer-side workspace.list round-trip; orchestrators that know which
 * ptyId they spawned can filter directly. If a caller needs paneId they
 * can pull it from `pane.list` once and cache.
